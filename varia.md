# How to live on this planet ~(anymore)~

Not sure yet where this list goes, maybe some lifehacks and global issues.

- [Low‚ÜêTech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) is an interesting read 
  on past knowledge and technologies, especially helpful in reducing energy usage.
  As the website is solar powered, it could go offline ocasionally

- [How To Speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY) -
  great talk on giving talks

- [Evidence Based Scheduling (article by Joel Spolsky)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/)
